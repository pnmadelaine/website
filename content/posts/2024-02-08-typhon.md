summary: Announcing Typhon!
---

Last weekend, [Lucas Franceschino](https://lucas.franceschino.fr) and I
officialy announced [Typhon](https://github.com/typhon-ci/typhon)!

We presented it at
[FOSDEM](https://video.fosdem.org/2024/h1302/fosdem-2024-2847-typhon-nix-based-continuous-integration.av1.webm)
and on the [NixOS
discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/typhon-nix-based-continuous-integration/39281).

Typhon is a prototype for Nix-based continuous integration, iterating over the
concepts of Hydra and introducing actions to replace plugins. It is already
running CI for itself (see [etna.typhon-ci.org](https://etna.typhon-ci.org/))
and we think that it is ready for a public beta. If you are interested in trying
it, be sure to check the [documentation](https://typhon-ci.org/): after a
general introduction it contains instructions to install Typhon and configure a
simple GitHub project.
